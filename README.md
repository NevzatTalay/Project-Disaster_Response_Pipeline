## Project Definition
The algorithm is trained on a dataset of over 50,000 disaster response messages. It is able to classify messages into 36 categories, including needs, safety, aid etc.

The Flask application makes it easy to use the algorithm. Simply type messages to the application, and it will generate a classification report. The report includes the category for each message.

Disaster Response Pipeline is a valuable tool for emergency responders and humanitarian organizations. It can help to quickly and efficiently identify the needs of people affected by a disaster.
